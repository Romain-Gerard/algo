## Type B strongly separated set partitions
A strongly separated partition is a partition in which all integers within the same block are non-consecutive, regardless of their sign.

We give a bijection between type B strongly separated set partitions and type B set partitions without zero block over <n>.

Let $SS^B_n$ denote the set of type B strongly separated partitions without zero block over <n>.

We define the map $g : \PI^B_n$
